Born and raised in Houston, Texas, she performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child, and rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of R&B girl-group Destiny's Child. Managed by her father, Mathew Knowles, the group became one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time. Their hiatus saw the release of Beyoncé's debut album, Dangerously in Love (2003), which established her as a solo artist worldwide, earned five Grammy Awards and featured the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles 'Crazy in Love' and 'Baby Boy'.\"\n","\n","answer=qa_pipeline(question=question,\n","             context=context)\n","print('\\n',answer['answer'])"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["question = \"Charlie's Angels featured which single from the band members?\"\n","context = \"The remaining band members recorded Independent Women Part I, which appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film, Charlie's Angels. It became their best-charting single, topping the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart for eleven consecutive weeks. In early 2001, while Destiny's Child was completing their third album, Beyoncé landed a major role in the MTV made-for-television film, Carmen: A Hip Hopera, starring alongside American actor Mekhi Phifer. Set in Philadelphia, the film is a modern interpretation of the 19th century opera Carmen by French composer Georges Bizet. When the third album Survivor was released in May 2001, Luckett and Roberson filed a lawsuit claiming that the songs were aimed at them. The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 663,000 copies sold. The album spawned other number-one hits, Bootylicious and the title track, Survivor, the latter of which earned the group a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. After releasing their holiday album 8 Days of Christmas in October 2001, the group announced a hiatus to further pursue solo careers.\"\n","\n","answer=qa_pipeline(question=question,\n","             context=context)\n","print('\\n',answer['answer'])"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"03Tab1JB3IUC","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1719888024935,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":3689,"user":{"displayName":"Chandra Viriya Hartantio","userId":"16251750091405170123"}},"outputId":"51332f8d-1ef7-48c7-a662-686209807206"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n"," Independent Women Part I,\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["question = \"how do we achieve a healthy body\"\n","context = \"an old man once said that the keys to everlasting wealth are health, friends, and family.
